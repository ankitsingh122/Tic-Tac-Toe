# Tic Tac Toe Game

This is a simple command-line implementation of the classic Tic Tac Toe game in Java.

## Features

- Allows two players to play Tic Tac Toe.
- Supports basic command-line interface for player interaction.
- Displays the current state of the game board after each move.
- Determines the winner or declares a draw when the game is over.

## How to Play

1. Clone this repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/tic-tac-toe.git
    ```

2. Compile the Java source files:

    ```bash
    javac *.java
    ```

3. Run the game:

    ```bash

4. Follow the on-screen instructions to play the game. Players take turns entering their moves by specifying the row and column numbers (1-3) where they want to place their mark.
